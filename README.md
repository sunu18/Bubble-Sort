# Bubble-Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through a list of elements to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

The basic idea behind bubble sort is to repeatedly traverse the list and compare adjacent elements, swapping them if they are in the wrong order. At the end of each traversal, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the list "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the list.

Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements to be sorted. This makes it an inefficient algorithm for large datasets, but it can be useful for small datasets or as a learning tool.

Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement, but it is not very efficient for large datasets. Other sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort are more efficient and are often preferred in practice. However, bubble sort can still be useful in some cases, such as when sorting a small number of elements or as a learning tool to understand the basic concepts of sorting algorithms.
